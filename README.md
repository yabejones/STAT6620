# STAT6620
CSU East Bay, Statistical Learning with R, Spring 2016

Hi. I'm a Master's student in Business Analytics, at Cal State East Bay.

This is my repo for Statistics 6620, Statistical Learning in R.

I'm pretty clueless in how to use Github as you will undoubtedly notice right away, but we all gotta start somewhere...

Thanks,
-Yumiko
